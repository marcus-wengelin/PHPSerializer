# PHPSerializer
Python utility for creating serialized PHP objects. Primary use case is exploiting PHP object injection vulnerabilities.

It may be difficult to set up the PHP environment required to serialize objects, and even more difficult to write the serialized payloads from scratch. Hence, I wrote this simple utility.
